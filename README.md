Develop a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.

Assignment1The Requirements analysis and specification document (RASD) contains the description of the scenarios, the use cases that describe them, and the models describing requirements and specification for the problem under consideration. 

Assignment2The Design document (DD) must contain a functional description of the system, and any other view you find useful to provide. 

Assignment3The Integration Test Plan Document (ITPD) aims at describing how you plan to accomplish the integration test. This document is supposed to be written before the integration test really happens. Often it is written in parallel to the Design Document and takes the architectural description of the software system as a starting point. This document needs to explain to the development team what to test, in which sequence, which tools are needed for testing (if any), and which stubs/drivers/oracles need to be developed. 

Assignment4The Project Plan (PP) aims at defining a planning for your project.
