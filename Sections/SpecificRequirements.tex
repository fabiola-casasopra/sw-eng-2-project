\subsection{External Interface Requirements} \label{external}

\subsubsection{User Interface} \label{user_interface}

In this section, we will present some mockup to make the reader better understand the idea of the structure of the final web page and application.

\myparagraph{Log In} 
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:login} shows the login page of PowerEnJoy. Here, a VISITOR can log in into the application.

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Registration Form}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:registration} shows the registration form, where a VISITOR can sign up to access the service.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:registration}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Personal page}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:mypage} shows the personal page of a USER, from where he can update his data, such as, for example, the profile picture, the password and the payment information.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/MyPage}
\caption{Personal Page mockup}
\label{fig:mypage}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Reservation page}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:reservation} shows the page from which a USER can reserve a car nearby him or near to a selected address for an hour.
He can also see how much time takes to get from the selected point to the car and its condition: level of charge and if it is plugged in a power grid station.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/Reservation}
\caption{Reservation Page mockup}
\label{fig:reservation}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

Once the USER has made his reservation, the page and application will show him a 1 hour timer, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:timer}, in order to remind him how much time he has left to go and pick up the reserved car. In this time, the USER can decide to cancel his prenotation by clicking on the button "\textit{Cancel}". Only when the USER is nearby the car, he will be able to click the "\textit{I'm there}" button to unlock the reserved car.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/Timer}
\caption{Reservation Timer Page mockup}
\label{fig:timer}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

If the car is not picked up within an hour, the reservation expires: the USER is reminded that he has to pay a fee of 1 EUR, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:expired}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:expired}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Safe Areas page}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:safe} shows the page where the USER can visualize the safe areas around him or around a selected adderess.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/SafePlaces}
\caption{Safe Areas Page mockup}
\label{fig:safe}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Power Grid Stations page}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:power} shows the page where the USER can visualize the power grid stations around him or around a selected adderess.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/ChargePlaces}
\caption{Power Grid Station Page mockup}
\label{fig:power}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{User's transactions page}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:transactions} shows the page where the USER can visualize his transactions and the relative details, such as the date of the ride, its duration and the discount or the increase on the fee to be payed.

\vspace{80pt}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Mockups/MyTransactions}
\caption{User's Transactions Page mockup}
\label{fig:transactions}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\myparagraph{Car Screen}
\newline
The mockup in Figure \ref{fig:car} shows the car screen where useful information are visualized, for example the current level of charge, the duration of the rent and how much the USER has to pay before any discount or increase on the fee are applied.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} \label{hw_interfaces}
Device should be enabled with Internet and GPS receiver.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces} \label{sw_interfaces}
The user's browser should be HTML5 compatible and the resolution should be at least 1280x720 for a satisfactory user experience.

%\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces} \label{comm_interfaces}
