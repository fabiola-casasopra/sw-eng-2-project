\section{Program Stubs and Test Data Required} \label{sec:pstdr}
%Based on the testing strategy and test design,identify any program stubs or special test data required for each integration step.

\subsection{Program Stub}

In order to carry out the testing phase for our project, we need two specific drivers that will simulate the behaviour of the client side.
In particular, we need at least the Visitor Driver and the User Driver.
\newline

The Visitor Driver should simulate the calling of the following function:

\begin{itemize}

\item[\textbf{--}] create a new user, by filling the registration form;

\item[\textbf{--}] log in, by inserting the proper username and password.

\end{itemize}

The User Driver should simulate the calling of the following function:

\begin{itemize}

\item[\textbf{--}] vizualize the Personal Page;

\item[\textbf{--}] modify the information on his Personal Page;

\item[\textbf{--}] reserve a car;

\item[\textbf{--}] delete an already existent reservation;

\item[\textbf{--}] vizualize the Safe Areas near to a location;

\item[\textbf{--}] vizualize the Power Grid Stations near to a location;

\item[\textbf{--}] vizualize all its past transactions;

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Data Required}

In order to carry out the testing phase for our project, we need to populate some Database table that will simulate the real data that our application needs.
\newline

In particular, we need to populate the following tables:

\begin{itemize}

\item[\textbf{--}] User;
\item[\textbf{--}] Car;
\item[\textbf{--}] Reservation;
\item[\textbf{--}] Safe Area;
\item[\textbf{--}] Power Grid Station;
\item[\textbf{--}] Transaction;

\end{itemize}

Moreover, it would be useful to have a dataset of location data, so that we can simulate inputs from from the users' smartphones and the \acs{gps} Receiver of the cars.
